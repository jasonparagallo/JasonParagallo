            Hi! I'm Jason Paragallo, a data analyst with experience and skills in SQL, Python, Power BI, data engineering, and machine learning. 
            I have a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights—finding patterns in what might seem like endless rows of information 
            and turning them into insightful visualizations and predictive models.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Surprisingly, my interest in analytics was inspired by my love for hockey. Around 2018, analytics became very popular in the hockey world, 
            with data scientists and analysts sharing their models and visualizations online. Some predicted the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal, 
            while others quantified player effectiveness. This explosion of data made the average hockey fan much more informed, and I was desperate to 
            learn how to create these same insights.
        </p>

            So in 2020, during my sophomore year of college, I took the plunge. I decided to major in Business Analytics, where I learned everything from 
            deep neural networks to interactive visualizations in Tableau. Since then, I’ve been continuously working on building these skills and adding 
            new ones to my toolkit.
