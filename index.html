        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Hi! I'm Jason Paragallo, a data analyst with experience in <strong>SQL, Python, Power BI, data engineering, and machine learning.</strong> 
            I have a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights—finding patterns in what might seem like endless rows of information 
            and turning them into insightful visualizations and predictive models.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Surprisingly, my interest in analytics was inspired by my love for <strong>hockey.</strong> Around 2018, analytics became very popular in the hockey world, 
            with data scientists and analysts sharing their models and visualizations online. Some predicted the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal, 
            while others quantified player effectiveness. This explosion of data made the average hockey fan much more informed, and I was desperate to 
            learn how to create these same insights.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            So in 2020, during my sophomore year of college, I took the plunge. I decided to major in <strong>Business Analytics,</strong> where I learned everything from 
            deep neural networks to interactive visualizations in Tableau. Since then, I’ve been continuously working on building these skills and adding 
            new ones to my toolkit.
