        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-4">
            <li><strong class="text-blue-300">Hockey</strong> - Hockey has played a huge role in my life. Growing up, my family built backyard rinks in the winter, which sparked my love for the game. I started playing at eight years old and continued through college. Now, I coach my high school’s Junior Varsity program and work as the Defensive Coach for the Varsity team, which has been a rewarding experience. I’m also a big Devils fan and a huge supporter of Jesper Bratt.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-blue-300">Music</strong> - Music is another major passion of mine. I love both listening to and creating music, and some of my favorite artists include Anathema, Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, and Sigur Rós. After high school, I dedicated time to learning instruments like guitar, bass, and piano. I also enjoy producing music and experimenting with new sounds using virtual synthesizers.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-blue-300">Animals</strong> - I’ve always loved animals and keep a few unique pets. My tortoise, Tortellini, is an Eastern Hermann’s tortoise native to Greece. I also have a planted fish tank with colorful guppies and a vivarium housing blue poison dart frogs (Dendrobates tinctorius). A fun fact about them—they aren’t actually poisonous in captivity, as their toxicity comes from their wild diet.</li>
